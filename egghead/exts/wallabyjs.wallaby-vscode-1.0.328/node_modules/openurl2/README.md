openurl2 â€“ Node.js module for opening URLs
=========================================

openurl2 is a Node.js module for opening a URL via the operating system. This will usually trigger actions such as:

- http URLs: open the default browser
- mailto URLs: open the default email client
- file URLs: open a window showing the directory (on OS X)

Example interaction on the Node.js REPL:

    > require("openurl").open("http://rauschma.de")
    > require("openurl").open("mailto:john@example.com")
    
You can generate emails as follows:

    require("openurl").mailto(["john@example.com", "jane@example.com"],
        { subject: "Hello!", body: "This is\nan automatically sent email!\n" });
    
Install via npm:

    npm install openurl2

In the original openurl package, there was an issue with URL's opening a Windows Explorer window, instead of 
an Email Client Window. This has been fixed in this fork. As the original Project is no longer maintained, 
we figured there was no point sending in a pull request, and instead pushed this Fork.
