# üéÑ Christmas Notice ‚òÉÔ∏è

### This project started on 3 Dec 2016. Now 5 years later, it has become a native feature in VSCode.

### This extension has seen wilder success then I could over ever dreamed of, with over 10M+ downloads.

### However since native functionality is available, it's time to deprecate this extension

### If you enjoyed it, a coffee donation is appreciated:
### Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!

## How to enable native bracket matching:

`settings.json`
```
{
    "editor.bracketPairColorization.enabled": true,
    "editor.guides.bracketPairs":"active"
}
```
